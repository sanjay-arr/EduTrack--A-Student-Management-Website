# 🎓 EduTrack - Student Academic Management System

**EduTrack** is a comprehensive academic dashboard designed to help college students track their grades, manage attendance, meet deadlines, and build professional resumes. 

It features a **Hybrid Data Architecture**: personal data (like detailed marks) is stored locally for privacy, while cloud-sync features (Attendance, Deadlines) are powered by **Supabase** to allow access across devices.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/EduTrack.git](https://github.com/yourusername/EduTrack.git)
    cd EduTrack
    ```

2.  **Supabase Configuration**
    This project uses Supabase for Authentication, Attendance, and Deadlines.
    * Create a project at [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
    * Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard and run the following script to set up the tables:

    ```sql
    -- 1. Attendance Table
    create table attendance (
      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
      subject text not null,
      total int not null,
      present int not null,
      created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
    );

    -- 2. Deadlines Table
    create table deadlines (
      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
      title text not null,
      date timestamp with time zone not null,
      type text not null, -- 'Assignment', 'Exam', etc.
      created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
    );

    -- 3. Enable RLS (Row Level Security)
    alter table attendance enable row level security;
    alter table deadlines enable row level security;

    -- 4. Create Security Policies (Users can only see their own data)
    create policy "Users can view their own attendance" on attendance for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
    create policy "Users can insert their own attendance" on attendance for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
    create policy "Users can delete their own attendance" on attendance for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);

    create policy "Users can view their own deadlines" on deadlines for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
    create policy "Users can insert their own deadlines" on deadlines for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
    create policy "Users can delete their own deadlines" on deadlines for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);
    ```

3.  **Link Credentials**
    Open `script.js` and replace the configuration at the top with your own Supabase details:
    ```javascript
    const PROJECT_URL = '[https://your-project-url.supabase.co](https://your-project-url.supabase.co)';
    const API_KEY = 'your-anon-public-key';
    ```

4.  **Run the App**
    Open `index.html` in your browser (or use Live Server in VS Code).
